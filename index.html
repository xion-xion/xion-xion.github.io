    <h2>About Me</h2>
    <p>I’m a tinkerer at heart. My career really kicked off with the excitement of a drone startup, and that got me hooked on the whole tech stack—from wiring up hardware to writing the code that brings it to life. I realized pretty quickly that the coolest innovations happen when you bridge the gap between the physical world and the digital one.</p>
    <p>Basically, I love making machines 'talk and think.' There’s nothing better than taking a messy, manual process and turning it into a smooth, automated system. I live for that 'aha!' moment when a client sees their data on a screen for the first time and realizes everything just got easier.</p>
    <p>Some of the stuff I’m proudest of:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><b>Factory IoT:</b> Built a system that stopped machines from breaking down constantly (cut downtime by 80%).</li>
        <li><b>Hardware Design:</b> Engineered a water quality sensor that worked perfectly but cost 75% less than the big brands.</li>
        <li><b>Entrepreneurship:</b> Built a self-service laundry business from scratch and automated the operations so it basically runs itself.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>I’m always looking for the next hard problem to solve. If you’re into building smarter systems or just want to geek out about automation, let’s connect.</p>
