            <h2>Project Summary</h2>
            <p>Designed and deployed a fully autonomous drone platform capable of operating in remote environments without human intervention. The system was engineered as a versatile aerial tool to solve critical operational challenges in both Agriculture and Aquaculture.</p>
    
            <h3>The Core Technology</h3>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Self-Sufficient Autonomy:</strong> Co-engineered a solar-powered docking station that enabled the drone to land, recharge, and upload data automatically.</li>
                <li><strong>High Endurance:</strong> Achieved 45-minute flight times, allowing for extensive coverage of large plantation areas.</li>
                <li><strong>Reliability:</strong> Validated through twice-daily automated flights, proving the system could operate continuously in harsh outdoor conditions.</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Application 1: Precision Agriculture (Palm Oil)</h3>
            <h4>The Challenge:</h4>
            <p>Manual inspection of vast plantations was labor-intensive and too slow to catch disease outbreaks early.</p>
            <h4>The Solution:</h4>
            <p>The drone performed automated aerial scanning to identify unhealthy trees.</p>
            <h4>The Impact:</h4>
            <p>Replaced slow manual checks with rapid, consistent aerial monitoring, enabling early intervention to prevent crop loss.</p>

            <h3>Application 2: Smart Aquaculture (Shrimp Farming)</h3>
            <h4>The Challenge:</h4>
            <p>Incorrect placement of paddle wheel aerators leads to dead zones (low oxygen) and poor waste management. If sludge does not gather in the center of the pond, it increases the risk of disease.</p>
            <h4>The Solution:</h4>
            <p>The drone captured high-resolution aerial imagery to map the exact position and orientation of a paddle wheels.</p>
            <h4>The Impact:</h4>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Disease Control:</strong> Verified that water currents effectively pushed sludge to the center drain, keeping the living area clean.</li>
                <li><strong>Oxygen Optimization:</strong> Ensured aerators were positioned to distribute oxygen evenly across the entire pond, which is critical for shrimp survival.</li>
            </ul>
