        <h3>Hands-On Deployment & Installation</h3>
        <p>As the deployment manager, I was responsible for the end-to-end installation process. This involved site assessments, hands-on device setup, and ensuring a seamless 'zero-infrastructure' deployment for our clients, directly clipping onto existing meters without any wire cutting.</p>

                <h3>Led Mobile App UI/UX Design</h3>
                <p>I led the UI/UX design for the mobile application, focusing on translating complex energy data into actionable financial insights for business owners. The goal was to create an intuitive interface that clearly visualized cost savings, such as the 'Peak vs. Off-Peak' usage, empowering users to make informed decisions.</p>

                <h3>Software Vendor Management & Data Logic</h3>
                <p>I acted as the technical bridge between the hardware and the external software development team. I was responsible for translating raw sensor data logic into clear requirements for the developers, ensuring the app displayed accurate energy metrics. I also led the UI/UX feedback loop, gathering insights from field installations to guide the software team in building features that customers actually needed.</p>
