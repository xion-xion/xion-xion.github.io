        <h3>Hands-On Deployment & Installation</h3>
        <p>As the deployment manager, I was responsible for the end-to-end installation process. This involved site assessments, hands-on device setup, and ensuring a seamless 'zero-infrastructure' deployment for our clients, directly clipping onto existing meters without any wire cutting.</p>

                <p>I led the UI/UX design for the mobile application, focusing on translating complex energy data into actionable financial insights for business owners. The goal was to create an intuitive interface that clearly visualized cost savings, such as the 'Peak vs. Off-Peak' usage, empowering users to make informed decisions.</p>
