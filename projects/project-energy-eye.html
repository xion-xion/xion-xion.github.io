                <h3>Removing Barriers to Adoption</h3>
                <p>I identified that high installation costs were preventing commercial clients from adopting energy monitoring. To solve this, I directed the engineering team to utilize Non-Intrusive Optical Interfaces and Sigfox 0G Networks. This architectural decision eliminated the need for wiring or WiFi, reducing installation time by 90%.</p>

                <h3>Vendor Coordination & Quality Control</h3>
                <p>Managed the end-to-end hardware development lifecycle across external vendors. I defined strict technical requirements for a 'Zero-Infrastructure' device, pushing for a 2-year battery life and standalone connectivity to ensure the product was scalable for mass market deployment.</p>

                <h3>Designing for Business Value</h3>
                <p>Led the UI/UX design phase for the mobile application. I focused on translating raw engineering data (kWh) into financial insights (Cost per Day) that business owners could actually use. I designed the 'Peak vs. Off-Peak' visualization to help users identify specific times to cut costs.</p>
