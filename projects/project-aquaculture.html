        <h2>Project Summary</h2>
        <p>Spearheaded the complete evolution of an aquaculture monitoring ecosystem, moving from component-level R&D to full-scale system deployment. The goal was to democratize data-driven farming for shrimp farmers by building a solution that was both affordable (Hardware) and highly reliable (Software).</p>

        <h3>Hardware Ecosystem</h3>
        <p>To tackle the high cost of off-the-shelf sensors, I engineered a full hardware stack from the ground up, cutting costs by 75% without sacrificing reliability. Each component was designed for autonomous, long-term deployment in harsh aquatic environments.</p>

                <h4>Custom Sensor Housing</h4>
                <p>Engineered a low-cost PVC housing with 3D-printed mounts to protect sensitive electronics while allowing water flow.</p>

                <h4>Solar Floating Unit</h4>
                <p>Designed a self-balancing floating chassis with integrated solar panels for 24/7 operation in the middle of ponds.</p>

                <h4>LoRaWAN Base Station</h4>
                <p>Built a central gateway that collects data from all nodes via long-range LoRa and pushes it to the cloud via cellular (SIM).</p>

                <h4>Spatial Real-Time Monitoring</h4>
                <p>Developed a geospatial dashboard using Google Maps API. Farm managers can see the live status of every pond instantly (Green=Safe, Red=Critical), allowing them to manage vast areas without physical inspection.</p>

                <h4>Actionable Alarm System</h4>
                <p>The system doesn't just show data; it diagnoses issues. It tracks specific pond operators and logs detailed alarm histories (e.g., 'Temperature too high'), ensuring accountability and rapid response.</p>
