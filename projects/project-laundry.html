                <h3>Hands-On Maintenance & Cost Reduction</h3>
                <p>Applied engineering principles to operations. Instead of relying on expensive external contractors, I personally handled machine diagnostics and repairs. This hands-on approach, combined with rigorous preventive maintenance SOPs, slashed operational costs by 50% and maximized machine uptime.</p>
